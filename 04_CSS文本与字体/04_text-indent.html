		Implicit layer animations are achieved using action objects, which are generic objects that implement a predefined interface. Core Animation uses action objects to implement the default set of animations normally associated with layers. You can create your own action objects to implement custom animations or use them to implement other types of behaviors too. You then assign your action object to one of the layerâ€™s properties. When that property changes, Core Animation retrieves your action object and tells it to perform its action.
